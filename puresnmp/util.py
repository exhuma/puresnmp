    """
    Converts a list of varbinds into a table-like structure. *num_base_nodes*
    can be used for table which row-ids consist of multiple OID tree nodes. By
    default, the last node is considered the row ID, and the second-last is the
    column ID. Example:

    By default, for the table-cell at OID ``1.2.3.4.5``, ``4`` is the column
    index and ``5`` is the row index.

    Using ``num_base_nodes=2`` will only use the first two nodes (``1.2``) as
    table-identifier, so ``3`` becomes the column index, and ``4.5`` becomes
    the row index.

    The output should *not* be considered ordered in any way. If you need it
    sorted, you must sort it after retrieving the table from this function!

    Each element of the output is a dictionary where each key is the column
    index. By default the index ``0`` will be added, representing the row ID.

    Example::

        >>> data = [
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.1.1'), 'row 1 col 1'),
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.1.2'), 'row 2 col 1'),
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.2.1'), 'row 1 col 2'),
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.2.2'), 'row 2 col 2'),
        >>> ]
        >>> tablify(data)
        [
            {'0': '1', '1': 'row 1 col 1', '2': 'row 1 col 2'},
            {'0': '2', '1': 'row 2 col 1', '2': 'row 2 col 2'},
        ]


    Example with longer row ids (using the *first* two as table identifiers)::

        >>> data = [
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.1.5.10'), 'row 5.10 col 1'),

        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.2.5.10'), 'row 5.10 col 2'),
        >>>     (ObjectIdentifier.from_string('1.2.2.6.10'), 'row 6.10 col 2'),
        >>> ]
        >>> tablify(data, num_base_nodes=2)
