Quick Info
----------

What
    A pure Python implementation for Python 3.3+ of SNMP without any external
    dependencies (neither MIBs or libsnmp).

Why
    SNMP in itself is simple and well defined. A bit convoluted, but simple.
    MIB parsing however complicates the code-base and is *technically* not
    required. They add typing information and variables and give names to OIDs.
    All existing libraries have a direct or indirect dependency on libsnmp.
    With all the advantages and disadvantages.

    The aim of this project is to focus on SNMP in itself and provide a very
    simple API. Instead of implementing ASN.1 parsing, the SNMP related ASN.1
    and X.690 information is hard-coded (keeping in mind that all that's
    hard-coded is well defined).

    It is of course possible to *wrap* this package in another package adding
    MIB parsing and processing. This is, and will be however **out of the scope
    of this project**!
